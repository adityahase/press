# Bill Payments

Your account balance accrues over the course of the calendar month based on
usage of your sites. We apply GST taxes to Indian customers.

We automatically invoice and charge your account's default payment method on the
last day of every month for the month's usage.

## Current Month's Usage

You can check your running usage amount in the Dashboard.

Go to Settings > Billing. Here you will see the usage amount to date. This
amount is updated every day based on the number of Active sites you have.

You can add cards from the Payment Methods section in the Billing Tab.

Click on **Add Payment Method** and enter your billing address and card details.
It will automatically become the default payment method.

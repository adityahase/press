# Creating a new site

Simplest guide to create a new site on Frappe Cloud


1. From the Sites tab on the dashboard, click on **New Site**.
1. Choose a unique hostname for your site. Subdomain could be 5 to 32 characters
   long and contain lowercase alphabets, numbers, and hyphens. Subdomain can not
   start or end with hyphens.

1. From the dropdown, select the major version for your site. We currently offer
   Version 12, Version 13 and Nightly (bleeding edge) versions.
1. Choose the apps to install on your site. The Frappe app will always be
   installed on your site by default. You can install more apps after your site
   is created.

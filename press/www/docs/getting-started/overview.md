# Overview

Frappe Cloud is a managed hosting service purpose-built for [Frappe
Framework](https://frappeframework.com) based sites.

It helps you get rid of manual operations like setting up a server, installing
dependencies, managing security upgrades, etc. Frappe Cloud takes out all the
hassle so that you can focus on creating and managing sites saving valuable time
for your organization.

## Easy to use

When you want to host a Frappe site, for e.g [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com), you
need to rent a server, install bench with all it's dependencies, install frappe
framework, create a site, setup custom domain, setup automated backups, setup
monitoring, setup logging, manage upgrades, handle upgrade failures, and many
more unknown problems that come with self hosting.

This is the problem Frappe Cloud solves, you dont need to do any of those steps,
and you can directly create sites on demand without touching the command line at
all.

## Continous deployment from Git

Frappe Cloud supports custom apps and integration with GitHub. You can keep
developing your apps and Frappe Cloud will pull latest commits and perform
deployments on your sites. You can opt for automatic deployments or manual
deployments.

## No vendor lock-in

Frappe Cloud gives you automated as well as on-demand backups for your sites. At
any point, you can trigger the latest backup, download it and move it to a cloud
provider of your choice.

## Affordable Pricing

Frappe Cloud starts with $10 per site per month, so you can give it a test spin
without investing too much. You even get a free $25 credit on signup.
